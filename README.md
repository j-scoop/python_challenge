# Python Challenge

## Python Challenge is a series of programming puzzles designed to be solved in Python. This repo contains my answers to these puzzles!

### Get puzzled at [pythonchallenge.com](pythonchallenge.com). Note, I did not make Python Challenge, these are merely my answers to the challenge!

Looking at my answers will spoil your experience of Python Challenge if you haven't attempted the puzzles yourself. You have been warned.
