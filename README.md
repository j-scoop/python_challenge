# Python Challenge

## Python Challenge is a series of programming puzzles designed to be solved in Python. This repo contains my answers to these puzzles!

### Get puzzled at [pythonchallenge.com](pythonchallenge.com). Note, I did not make Python Challenge, these are merely my answers to the challenge!

Looking at my answers will spoil your experience of Python Challenge if you haven't attempted the puzzles yourself. You have been warned.

### How to run
Simply execute `python -m levels.one` from the project directory to run the script for the first level, and so on.
